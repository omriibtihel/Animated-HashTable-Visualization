# Animated-HashTable-Visualization
This Java project provides a visual representation of a hash table, allowing users to add and remove words interactively. Each added word animates into its position within the hash table, enhancing the learning experience with a dynamic and engaging interface.

Features
Interactive Input: Users can add words via a text field and remove them with a button click.
Smooth Animation: Added words move smoothly from the top of the panel to their respective positions in the hash table.
Visual Feedback: The hash table structure is visually represented with clear cell borders and directional arrows, making it easy to understand the data flow.
Custom Styling: Modern and clean UI design using custom fonts, colors, and rounded buttons for an improved user experience.

How It Works
Adding Words: Enter a word in the text field and click "Add" or press Enter. The word will animate from the top of the panel to its appropriate position in the hash table.
Removing Words: Enter a word in the text field and click "Remove". If the word exists in the hash table, it will be removed.
Visualization: The hash table is drawn dynamically, showing the current state of the hash table and the position of each word.

Dependencies
Java Swing: Used for creating the user interface and handling events.
Java AWT: Used for drawing graphics and animations.
